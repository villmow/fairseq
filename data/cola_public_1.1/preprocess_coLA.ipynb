    "## Split\n",
    "\n",
    "We have split the data into an in-domain set with sentences from 17 sources and an out-of-domain set with the remaining 6 sources. The in-domain set is split into train/dev/test sections, and the out-of-domain set is split into dev/test sections. The test sets are not made public. For convenience, each dataset is provided is provided twice, in raw form and in tokenized form (from the NLTK tokenizer). The public data is split into the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- raw/in_domain_train.tsv (8551 lines)\n",
    "- raw/in_domain_dev.tsv (527 lines)\n",
    "- raw/out_of_domain_dev.tsv (516 lines)\n",
    "- tokenized/in_domain_train.tsv (8551 lines)\n",
    "- tokenized/in_domain_dev.tsv (527 lines)\n",
    "- tokenized/out_of_domain_dev.tsv (516 lines)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line in the .tsv files consists of 4 tab-separated columns.\n",
    "- Column 1:\tthe code representing the source of the sentence.\n",
    "- Column 2:\tthe acceptability judgment label (0=unacceptable, 1=acceptable).\n",
    "- Column 3:\tthe acceptability judgment as originally notated by the author.\n",
    "- Column 4:\tthe sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Corpus Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "- clc95\t0\t*\tIn which way is Sandy very anxious to see if the students will be able to solve the homework problem?\n",
    "- c-05\t1\t\tThe book was written by John.\n",
    "- c-05\t0\t*\tBooks were sent to each other by the students.\n",
    "- swb04\t1\t\tShe voted for herself.\n",
    "- swb04\t1\t\tI saw that gas can explode.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "During gathering of the data and processing, some sentences from the source documents may have been omitted or altered. We retained all acceptable examples, and excluded any examples given intermediate judgments such as “?” or “#”. In addition, we excluded examples of unacceptable sentences not suitable for the present task because they required reasoning about pragmatic violations, unavailable semantic readings, or nonexistent words. We take responsibility for any errors."
